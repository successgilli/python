A web developer has option to choose from a wide range of web frameworks while using Python as server-side programming languages. He can take advantage of the full-stack Python web frameworks to accelerate development of large and complex web applications by availing a number of robust features and tools. Likewise, he can also opt for micro and lightweight Python web frameworks to build simple web applications without putting extra time and effort.

Both Django and Flask are hugely popular among Python programmers. Django is a full-stack web framework for Python, whereas Flask is a lightweight and extensible Python web framework. Django is developed based on batteries-included approach. It enables programmers to accomplish common web development tasks without using third-party tools and libraries. Django lacks some of the robust features provided by Python.
